## ðŸ§  Machine Learning Models:

The application employs the following algorithms to make predictions:

ðŸ”¹Logistic Regression

ðŸ”¹Support Vector Machine (SVM)

ðŸ”¹Decision Tree

ðŸ”¹Random Forest

ðŸ”¹Grid Search Optimized Random Forest

Each model uses 11 health-related input features to assess the risk of heart disease.
